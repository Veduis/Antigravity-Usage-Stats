## Rules
- Log everything you do in CHANGELOG.MD
- If you are an AI agent, you should cite your model in the changelog at the end of your entry like (Ex: - Claude 4.5 Opus or - Grok Fast Code 1)
- If I preface a message with "NC" or NC: or any other variation of NC, do not code just advise/think/explain
- Anytime you generate a readme, preface file name with date in format MM-DD-YYYY-FILENAME.md AND place it in the READMES folder. If multiple readmes are generated during the same day append (2) (3) (4) etc etc as needed
- If you are doing some sort of automated commit - attribute to email:cody@veduis.com name:Veduis

## Project Progress Tracking
- **ALWAYS** check `TODO.md` before starting any work to understand current project status
- **ALWAYS** update `TODO.md` after completing any task:
  1. Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
  2. Update phase progress counts (e.g., `1/5` → `2/5`)
  3. Update phase status emoji (⬜ → 🔄 → ✅)
  4. Update total progress count and percentage at the top
  5. Update the "Last Updated" date
- Reference `tek-spec.md` for detailed feature specifications
- Report current completion percentage when starting and finishing work sessions
